They didnâ€™t have toilets.
The lady was very welcoming and informative of the other Roman sites in Caerleon. It is a shame that the museum is not open on a Monday whereas the Baths are. How strange and inconvenient! I feel that the outside signage/directions to the nearby  sites could be improved. Signage unclear although we did find the sites after guidance from staff
Very impressed with the site itself - a lot of work had gone into making it feel modern and welcoming, helping us to take in all of the information properly 
An enjoyable experience to the roman baths. Although the only negative was lack of toilets on site. 
No
