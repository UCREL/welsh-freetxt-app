- It will be great when abstractive overtakes extractive summarization for Welsh.
- I’m not sure if the word cloud creator is treating hyphenated words like is-deitlau as a whole intity; it may be splitting the words. 
- Whereas the ngram  frequency tool deals well with some compouns such as “er enghraifft” and “llawer o” but also treated others like “Technoleg a” incorrectly as entities. < does all this make sense?
- I’m wondering what you could do to help the machine recognise compounds and terms which convey a single concept?
- I remember you mentioning that sentiment analysis is on the roadmap, which will be great.
